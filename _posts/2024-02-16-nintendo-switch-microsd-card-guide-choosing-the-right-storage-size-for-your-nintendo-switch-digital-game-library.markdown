## Part 1 - Introduction
The **Nintendo Switch console** only relies on microSD cards for expandable storage. While the system comes with 32GB of internal onboard storage, this is often not enough for those wanting to build a sizable digital game library. Games can only be downloaded and stored on the internal storage or a microSD card. With some titles taking up over 10GB each, storage needs can fill up fast. 
This extensive guide provides recommendations on microSD card capacities based on different types of digital game collections. Various card sizes and their suitability for casual, average, and power users are examined. Specific brand recommendations matching the storage tiers are also included. By gaining a better understanding of average game file sizes and your own playing habits, you can choose the right microSD card to optimize storage versus cost.
## Part 2 - Average Nintendo Switch Game File Sizes
Game file sizes can vary widely on the **Nintendo Switch**. Most indie and smaller third-party titles range between 1-3GB in size. First-party Nintendo games like **Mario Kart 8 Deluxe** and **The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild** clock in slightly higher at around 4-6GB each after updates. Some of the largest games exceed 10GB, such as **Doom** and **Bayonetta 2** which require over 13GB of storage. 
Knowing the file sizes of titles in your library or wishlist helps determine appropriate microSD card capacity. A selection of top games and their download sizes includes:
### Super Mario Odyssey - 4.1 GB

### Splatoon 2 - 4.4 GB  
### Pok√©mon: Let's Go, Pikachu! - 3.8 GB
### Fire Emblem Three Houses - 7.6 GB
### The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt - 13.4 GB
Understanding typical file sizes allows matching card size to digital library size.
## Part 3 - 64GB microSD Card: Best Entry-Level Option
The **64GB microSD card** offers a practical entry-level size for most casual Nintendo Switch owners. It provides enough storage for 10-15 average sized games and their updates. This strikes a good balance between price and usable capacity without costing much more than the basic 32GB cards. 
A 64GB card allows filling the Switch with your favorite first-party Nintendo games along with a handful of larger third-party titles. It accommodates filling the system with titles like **Super Mario Odyssey**, **Splatoon 2**, and **Fire Emblem Three Houses** together without storage worries. Even with some future-proofing, most casual users can get by quite comfortably with 64GB of microSD storage.
### Best Entry-Level Digital Game Storage
### Fits 10-15 Average Sized Games and Updates
### Good Balance of Price and Capacity
## Part 4 - 128GB microSD Card: Alternate Mid-Size Option 
For Switch owners looking to go predominantly or fully digital with larger libraries, the **128GB microSD card** provides a worthwhile upgrade. It roughly doubles the storage of a 64GB card to hold approximately 25 average sized games. This is enough capacity for full indie, AA, and mid-tier AAA game collections.
Power users or collectors can load up their Switch with a wide variety of genres, publishers, and game styles without storage limitations. Generous space remains for game updates, downloads, and capturing game screenshots or videos too. The 128GB tier ensures maximum flexibility for curating an extensive all-digital Switch library over the console's lifespan.
### Approximately Doubles Storage over 64GB 
### Fits 25 Average Sized Games
### Suits All-Digital Libraries or Larger Collections
## Part 5 - 256GB and Higher microSD Cards: For Enormous Digital Libraries  
Gamers amassing massive digital Switch libraries far exceeding 30 titles in size require moving up to **256GB or higher capacity microSD cards**. These top-tier cards deliver future-proofed storage able to hold 50 or more average sized games with room to spare. They are aimed at power users who download practically all their games digitally rather than purchasing physical cartridges.
While offering the most expansive storage options available, cards above 256GB also carry premium price tags. Their huge capacities excel for long-term users planning to stay fully digital over the console's 7-year lifespan as file sizes continue creeping larger each generation. However, 256GB+ storage tiers provide unnecessary overhead for the vast majority of Switch owners.
### Holds 50+ Average Sized Games
### Future-Proofed for Years of Digital Libraires 
### Best for Going Completely Download-Based
## Part 6 - Choosing the Right microSD Card Speed Class
In addition to capacity, the **read/write speeds** of a microSD card impact game performance. Nintendo recommends class 10 cards or higher for optimal loading times. Faster UHS speed classes lead to snappier game loads and more seamless transitions. 
Class 10 ensures sufficiently quick speeds, but the top-tier U3 rating delivers the best experience by minimizing lengthy waits between levels or menu screens. Higher speeds become more important for large install sizes over 10GB. However, if budget is a constraint, basic class 10 still gets the job done acceptably for most users.
### Class 10 Sufficient But U3 Ideal for Speed
### Faster Speeds Benefit Large Game Installs 
### Budget Class 10 Still Performs Respectably
## Part 7 - Other Storage Considerations
A few additional notes on Switch storage:
- Physical game cards do not take up internal storage space
- External hard drives are not compatible for portable Switch play, only supported while docked   
- Cloud saves require purchasing an individual or family Nintendo Switch Online membership
Maximizing storage depends on balancing digital versus physical games, capture software usage, and factoring in future-proofing needs.
## Part 8 - Recommended microSD Card Models
Here are specific microSD card models recommended based on common capacity tiers:
For 64GB storage:
- **SanDisk Ultra 64GB microSDXC** - Reliable brand and performance, great value 
- **Samsung EVO Select 64GB microSDXC** - Faster UHS-I speeds, higher end option
For 128GB capacity:  
- **SanDisk Ultra 128GB microSDXC** - Capable card at a fair mid-range price

For 256GB and above:

## Part 8 - Conclusion
In summary, choosing the optimal microSD card size requires understanding game file sizes, digital library needs, and budget. Even casual users can stay comfortably storage-equipped with a basic 64GB card. Larger collections demand 128GB or higher for full flexibility. While future-proofed 256GB+ options exist, most gamers can get by very well with mid-range options. Matching the right capacity microSD card to your Switch ensures optimized value and enjoyment of its digital library capabilities.
