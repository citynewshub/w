## A Unified Call of Duty Journey Across Devices
Call of Duty has established itself as one of the most popular multiplayer franchises in gaming today, bringing together massive online player bases across consoles and PCs. What makes the experience truly unified is the ability to carry your profile, customizations, and progress seamlessly between any platform simply by signing into your Activision account. In this guide, we'll explain how easy it is to connect your accounts and embark on a continuous Call of Duty journey no matter which device you decide to play on.
### Link All Your Gaming Platforms from Your Activision Profile 
The first step is to head over to the official Call of Duty website and sign into your pre-existing Activision account. Once logged in, look for the "Connected Accounts" option in the top-right corner of the screen. This is where you'll link any console or PC platforms you want your profile associated with such as **PlayStation**, **Xbox**, and **Windows PC**. Simply follow the prompts to authenticate with your profile on each additional platform. With a single sign-in to your Activision ID, you now have the freedom to easily switch between devices while keeping all your **unlocks, rankings, customizations** and more in one place.

### Continuously Progress Your Profile No Matter the Device
All **current generation Call of Duty titles** released since Modern Warfare 2019 are part of the **cross-progression system**, including the massively popular free-to-play battle royale Warzone. This means any **levels, stats, weapon customizations or inventory items** unlocked on one platform can be accessed on any other simply by logging into the same Activision profile. There's no need to restart your journey or repurchase content - just download the platform-specific version of the game and seamlessly pick up where you left off.
### Purchasing Games Across Consoles and PC  
While progression is fully shared between platforms, you will need to purchase the individual version of each Call of Duty game for each specific device. For example, if you want to play Vanguard on both PlayStation and Xbox, you'd need to buy copies for each console. The good news is your profile and all related content carries over without any additional fees. PC players also have the option to access select Call of Duty titles through an **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription** by downloading them on Windows via the Xbox app.
### Connect Your Xbox Profile to PC for Expanded Access
If you're an Xbox owner looking to also get in on the Call of Duty action on PC, connecting your Microsoft account is extremely beneficial. With an **Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership**, you gain access to download and play select titles from the franchise directly through your **Windows PC**. By signing into the Xbox app with the same profile used on console, all your progress and inventories are instantly available on your new platform of choice. Top games like Modern Warfare and Vanguard can easily be loaded up for big-screen battles wherever you set up.
### Ensure You Download the Right Version for Your Hardware
While profiles span platforms, **each device still requires the custom-built version of each game optimized for its hardware**. The PC, PlayStation, and Xbox editions may look nearly identical but have subtle differences under the hood to take full advantage of their respective platforms. When launching a Call of Duty title on a new system, be sure you've downloaded the matching version rather than attempting to play a copy made for another device which likely won't function properly. Activision makes it simple to get the appropriate edition through digital stores associated with your console or their own Battle.net PC launcher.
## Seamless Integration Between Console, PC and Warzone
### A Truly Shared Experience Across Devices  
Once your accounts are connected, your journey in Call of Duty is one that seamlessly flows between consoles, PC or the free-to-play Battle Royale experience of Warzone. Your progression persists in real-time no matter if you're grinding late at night on your PC or competing against friends on the couch. Unlocking new items like weapons and skills through General ranks or Battle Pass tiers applies to all linked platforms simultaneously. Even keeping track of friends lists and recently played communities brings a shared social experience.
### Constant Updates Delivered for All Hardware  
With the franchise focusing heavily on live seasons that introduce fresh content on a regular basis, it's important for updates to roll out concurrently across formats. Activision ensures this shared experience stays cohesive by deploying major patches, seasonal launches, and new in-game celebrations simultaneously for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. Your profile remains instantly up-to-date so you never fall behind regardless of platform. Even big yearly title launches synchronize downloads for a unified day-one experience.
### Cross-Play and Cross-Progression for a Vast Community  
At its core, **the ability to connect accounts** is what truly unifies the massive Call of Duty player network. Through cross-play support, you're able to team up, matchmake and compete against the entire sprawling community no matter if they're on console or PC. Then cross-progression takes that integration even further by allowing your profile, purchases and accomplishments to represent you to friends on any device. In the end, signing into your Activision ID is your gateway to experiencing the entire pulse-pounding CoD multiplayer universe as one.
## An Effortless Way to Play Your Way
Bringing your accomplishments, gear and identity seamlessly between console, PC and other platforms is what empowers players in Call of Duty to truly experience the action however they desire. The unified account system that Activision created makes switching between devices an utterly frictionless process maintained by a single sign-in. From living room couches and big screen TV displays to powerful gaming PCs and portable laptops - your journey and reputation persist. Linking accounts takes just minutes yet unlocks a lifetime of flexibility to play with friends old and new, exactly where you want. Whether at home or on the go, on the latest season's content or a classic CoD of the past, your profile is free to deploy wherever excitement calls.
