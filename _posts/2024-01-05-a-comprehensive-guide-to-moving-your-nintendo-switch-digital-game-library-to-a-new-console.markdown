## Part 1 - Considering an Upgrade to the Nintendo Switch
The Nintendo Switch has provided countless hours of entertainment since its release in 2017. Whether exploring Hyrule in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild or facing off against friends and family in Super Smash Bros Ultimate, the Switch never fails to delight. For many players, borrowing a friend's console to try out popular games only fuels the desire to build their own growing **digital game library**. 
While the original Switch model continues to impress, the recent release of the upgraded OLED model with its vibrant **7-inch OLED screen** and improved stand entices players looking to take their gaming on the go to an even higher level of visual fidelity and comfort. For those ready to upgrade, it's important to understand how to properly transition **digitally purchased Nintendo Switch games** to the new hardware.
## Part 2 - Licensing of Digital Nintendo Switch Games
When purchasing games from the Nintendo eShop, it's essential to grasp that the license for each **downloadable Switch title** is tied to the Nintendo account used during the transaction, not the console itself. This allows players flexibility in where they can enjoy their collection. 
The Switch recognizes one primary console where any account on that device can play and redownload digital titles without an internet connection or the purchasing account signed in. For non-primary consoles, the linked purchasing account must be signed in to play downloads or initiate redownloads. 
With game sharing in mind between multiple Switches in a household, designating a new primary console requires unlinking the association on the current primary device first before setting up the new one. Proper account management is key to ensuring a seamless transition of one's digital library.
## Part 3 - Migrating Your Digital Game Library to a New Switch Console
When the time comes to upgrade to a new Nintendo Switch, a few simple steps guarantee all **previously purchased digital Nintendo Switch games** can be enjoyed on the new hardware.
First, sign in to the current primary Switch being used and select "Detach this Console from this Account" from the eShop menu. This unlinks the console association. 
Sign in to the new Switch with the same account. Open the eShop and select "Primary Console" to designate the new device as the account's primary. 
After any necessary system updates, the new Switch is now set up to play all previously purchased digital games without an internet connection or need to sign in. Simply redownload titles from the menu or reinstall directly from the game card if using a physical cartridge.
In some cases, save data may need to be transferred separately. But in terms of license ownership and access, the new Switch is now the home for that user's full digital library.
## Part 4 - Game Compatibility Across Switch Models  
Both the original Switch and upgraded Switch OLED models can play **all Nintendo Switch games** regardless of release date or file size due to using the same Nvidia Tegra processor and operating system. However, some variations may exist:
- Visuals: Games may exhibit slightly improved anti-aliasing, effects, or resolution on the OLED's larger screen.
- Features: Online multiplayer, TV/handheld functionality are consistent, but OLED enhances the handheld experience.
- Hardware: Vibrant OLED display, improved audio, expanded internal storage on the upgraded model.
But the underlying game functionality and license to play **downloaded Switch titles** transfers seamlessly no matter the hardware. Both provide immersive gaming experiences on the TV and on the go. Overall compatibility remains the top priority for Nintendo's unified platform.
## Part 5 - Online Play Requirements
While single-player downloaded Switch games are fully accessible offline on the primary console, some titles like **Super Smash Bros Ultimate online multiplayer modes** require an active Nintendo Switch Online membership. This affordable subscription unlocks robust online functionality for select games.
The family membership can be shared across all consoles associated with the purchasing account. As long as one device remains designated as the primary console, all accounts on that Switch can enjoy online features even without the purchasing user signed in.
Be sure to budget for a Nintendo Switch Online individual or family plan if deep online multiplayer integration is important. The subscription auto-renews annually but can be easily paused as needed. It provides living proof of Nintendo's commitment to supporting their player community for years to come.
## Part 6 - Best Times to Purchase Digital Games
With the regular influx of new games plus seasonal sales, savvy Nintendo Switch digital shoppers watch for prime opportunities to expand their library at a discount. The Nintendo eShop frequently spotlights **games under $15** and bigger titles up to 30% off during major holidays and monthly promotions.
For example, selecting games currently on sale in the summer sale allows starting to enjoy those titles immediately via a friend's Switch before the full console upgrade. And there's no risk of the discounted price expiring before getting the new system.
Major **first-party Nintendo games** like Mario, Zelda and Pok√©mon rarely see deep discounts. But third-party publishers routinely slash prices on their catalog for limited times. Setting a budget and pulling the trigger on coveted games at a great value ensures the biggest digital library possible down the line.
Monitoring deal alerts and sale rotations optimizes the dollar spent versus enjoyment gained ratio. Digital shoppers who time purchases right maximize the value of every cent in their growing collection.
## Part 7 - Smooth Transitions Between Switch Consoles
To recap the hassle-free process, designated the current Switch as non-primary, initialized the upgraded Switch as the new primary console, and then all **digital Nintendo eShop games** can be instantly redownloaded without a hitch. Online authentication is seamlessly handled behind the scenes.
Sign out of the old Switch and sign back into the new one just to be thorough. Redownload or transfer saved data as desired, then it's back to the adventures of Link, Mario, and beyond in no time. Both the standard and premium Switch hardware provide equivalent gaming experiences from that point on.
Key is double checking the account management within the eShop menu rather than guessing. Taking five minutes to officially transfer the console association guarantees full control moving forward without risk of license issues down the road. With cloud saves also supported, the transition couldn't be simpler.
For those with large digital libraries built up over the Switch's lifespan, upgrading hardware is a no-brainer. The games selection comes along for the ride practically effortlessly.
