### Where Your Pokemon Sword and Shield Saves are Stored
The Nintendo Switch stores save files for Pokemon Sword and Shield internally instead of on the game cartridges like earlier Nintendo systems. **This allows your save data to be accessible regardless of what physical cartridge you insert into your Switch.** Your in-game progress and online data associated with your Nintendo Switch profile remain on the console's internal storage rather than the game cards themselves. Removing or deleting your user profile also removes all associated save files for any games tied to that profile.

### Your Saves Travel with You Thanks to Cloud Backups
A select number of Nintendo Switch titles like Pokemon Sword and Shield support backing up saves to the cloud through Nintendo Switch Online. This cloud saving feature lets you restore your most recent save file onto a new Nintendo Switch system. So if something happens to your original Switch, you don't lose your progress. Developers have control over which of their games offer this helpful cloud backup option though.
### Independence from Physical Media Frees Your Progress 
Earlier portable Nintendo systems tied save data internally to the game cartridges themselves. Swapping out Game Boy or Nintendo DS cartridges meant either starting those games from scratch or losing your save file progress entirely. The Switch removed this limitation by decoupling save files from physical media. Now your Pokemon adventures can continue regardless of whose Switch you play on or if you buy a new copy of the game digitally or physically.
### Keep Loans from Overwriting Your Original Saves 
Letting a friend borrow your copy of Pokemon Sword or Shield to try out for themselves poses no risk to your own save file. The Switch identifies each user profile separately, so every player has their own independent set of save data for each game they own. Loaners can enjoy the game without overwriting the progress of the owner. Once returned, your game will pick up exactly where you left off.
### Transfer Saves Locally Between Switches with Extra Steps
While cloud backups let you restore Pokemon saves onto another Switch online, direct copying of internal saves between systems locally is not supported straight out of the box. However, there may be methods like moving the save data files via local wireless instead. Players determined to transfer their adventures between multiple Switches they own would have to research additional workarounds.
### A Flexible Approach Respects Game Ownership
In conclusion, the Switch's handling of save files respects the ownership of digital games and cartridges more flexibly than past Nintendo portables. Independence from physical media, backup options in the cloud, and separation of individual user profiles all benefit players. They can feel secure continuing their Pokemon journeys anywhere without risk of overwriting each other's progress as a family. This model encourages game sharing among friends and family.
### Hackers Find Ways Around Restrictions
However, technically savvy users have discovered homebrew methods to directly copy internal Switch save files between systems without official support. While risky and potentially damaging, these hacks allow determined players to fully "transfer" games in a way Nintendo's designed permissions do not. But most see the value in Nintendo's approach that protects saves from accidental overwriting between different users and devices.
### save Data Storage is Vital for Online Games 
The storage of persistent save files becomes even more important for multiplayer online titles like Pokémon Sword and Shield's Max Raid Battles mode. Coordinating raids with others depends on save data tracking previously defeated bosses, numbers of wins, and unlocked rewards. If this profile progress could not be maintained on a user's device and restored from the cloud, the online components would not function meaningfully. Thankfully most major online games support syncing data in a way that enhances rather than hinders the shared experience.
### In Summary: Benefits of Save Independence 
To wrap up, the flexible approach to save data management on the Nintendo Switch provides several important benefits to Pokémon and other game players. By disassociating saves from physical media, users can freely continue existing games regardless of hardware possessions or changes. Backups to the cloud safeguard progress even if the original device fails. And separating saves by individual profiles lets families and friends safely share and loan games. Overall this independence respects game ownership while aiding portability and accessibility of users' game accomplishments.
